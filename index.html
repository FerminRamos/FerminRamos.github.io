                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A data analyst and computer scientist with a proven 
                    track record of transforming complex data into 
                    actionable insights. I’ve published academic 
                    research on health and socio-economic disparities, 
                    contributed to federally-affiliated analytical work 
                    through a highly selective data program with the CIA, 
                    and supported research teams in identifying community 
                    vulnerabilities using SQL, Python, Tableau, and 
                    ArcGIS. I’ve also won two competitive hackathons 
                    that led to investor-backed startup ventures. Now, 
                    I’m excited to apply my analytical mindset, risk 
                    awareness, and experience with large-scale data 
                    systems to the financial sector - especially in 
                    roles focused on forecasting, fraud detection, or 
                    investment analytics.</p>
